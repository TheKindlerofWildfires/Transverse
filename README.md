# Transverse

## Getting started with development:
0. Use IntelliJ. No support will be given for anyone not using IntelliJ.
1. If you have already cloned the project, close it in IntelliJ (`File -> Close Project`). 
2. Clone the repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/TheKindlerOfWildfires/Transverse.git`
        - Do not clone it through IntelliJ. It will attempt to reconfigure the project, and fail.
    - If you have already cloned the project, you may need to delete the files first.
3. In IntelliJ, open the project (`File -> Open...`, or `Open` from the splash menu, browse to the cloned location, and click open.)
    - **Really truly** do not let it configure the project. It is already correct.
4. Try running `main` or `Tests`. If you do not have the Kotlin plugin, you may need to install it.
5. Profi- uh... Develop!
